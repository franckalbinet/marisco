    "## Core Concept: Handlers\n",
    "\n",
    "`marisco` is built around the concept of `handlers` - specialized modules designed to convert MARIS datasets into NetCDF format. Each handler is tailored to a specific data provider and implemented as a dedicated Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Literate Programming Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We've adopted a Literate Programming approach, which means:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Documentation**: Each handler serves as comprehensive documentation.\n",
    "2. **Code Reference**: The notebooks contain the actual implementation code.\n",
    "3. **Communication Tool**: They facilitate discussions with data providers about discrepancies or inconsistencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Powered by nbdev\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we leverage [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai), a powerful tool that allows us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write code within Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "2. Automatically export relevant parts as dedicated Python modules\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach bridges the gap between documentation and implementation, ensuring they remain in sync.\n",
    "\n",
    "### See It in Action\n",
    "\n",
    "For a concrete example of this approach, check out our [HELCOM dataset handler implementation](https://fr.anckalbi.net/marisco/handlers/helcom.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that this project is **still under development**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have implemented the [MARIS Legacy handler](https://fr.anckalbi.net/marisco/handlers/maris_legacy.html) to convert all existing datasets from the MARIS master database into NetCDF format. For datasets that are frequently updated, such as [HELCOM](https://fr.anckalbi.net/marisco/handlers/helcom.html), [OSPAR](https://www.ospar.org/), and TEPCO/Fukushima-related datasets, individual handlers are currently being developed and will be available soon."

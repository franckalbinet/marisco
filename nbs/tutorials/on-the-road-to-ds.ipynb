    "I can tell you that in a matter of 1 hour you will learn a great deal and that it will be very rewarding\n",
    "There are few steps where you might struggle (when he opens the vi editor -which I use- but might seem cryptic). VI will be covered in later videos and not absolutely essential. Actually while you will have install (WSL - Windows Subsystem for Linux) you can also access files from your file explorer and edit them with notepad or anything you want\n",
    "maybe watching it a first time without touching your keyboard to see the big picture might be an option (though not sure). You can also skip many parts when the audience question is not that relevant... \n",

    "How to install WSL\n",
    "How to use the command line basics\n",
    "How to get a clean and very flexible python toolbox (using mamba)\n",
    "Install and run jupyter lab or notebooks\n",
